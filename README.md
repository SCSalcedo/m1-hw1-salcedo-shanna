## About Me ##
My name is Shanna! I live in Florida and have 2 dogs. I like to tuft rugs and crochet. I love trying new food, my mom, anything Spongebob, and spending time out by the water (in the summer of course).
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have literally no coding experience. However, I have made a couple websites with wordpress and wix. For sure this is way different than that!!!
## Career Goals ## 
1. Be a successful coder
2. Intern with a company that'll show me real world developing
3. Find a company that has potential to grow but needs someone like me to grow their company (I hope that makes sense)
4. increase earnings
